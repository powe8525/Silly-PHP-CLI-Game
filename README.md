## Introduction
This project is a something I wanted to do as a refresher after spending the last year in .NET. It's not meant to be a pristine example of how to PHP, Game design, UI or any other measure of code skills. I wanted to code and make mistakes, by the mistakes remember the rules, and through the rules own all the fat lewtz!

## Game Instructions
The game is a simple auto-battler. Just run the `index.php` to start.
1. Choose your class
2. Name your champion or leave it blank for the default name
3. Watch your victory or doom unfold

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/php-solid-playground.git
     ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd php-solid-playground
     ```
3. Install dependencies (if any):
     ```bash
     composer install
     ```
4. Update/create the autoloader
    ```bash
    composer dump-autoload
    ```
5. Play the game
    ```bash
    php index.php
    ```
## Todo
These are some things (or thing) I would like to do for fun.
- Add experiance system
  - Create and display level of hero
  - Track experiance gained while playing
  - Display level at the top of the game
- Add unique skills per class
  - Like the clerics healing, create skills for each class
- Different damage types and range per monster type
- Display report card after a number of battles
  - \# of fights
  - Win/losses
  - List of lewtz lewted
